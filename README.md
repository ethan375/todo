# GetMoreDone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.5.

## Overview
This is my first project developing in angular 2+. I have taken the tour of heroes and feel confident to venture out on my own.

## backstory 
I graduated a fullstack web development bootcamp in jan of 2020, two months later in march coronavirus hit and the world ended. Developing took somewhat of a backseat so that I could figure out how to survive while the world was shutting down. This project puts my passion for development back on the forefront of my life. I have chosen to make a todo app because every todo app that I have tried has been missing some feature that I deemed to be critical. So I decided I would help organize my life by creating the last todo app I'll ever need. As stated above this is my first angular 2+ project, I decieded I wanted to give myself a challenge put another framework in the marketablitiy bag. I have also developed a backend for the project with a link to that repo coming soon. The backend is written in javascript using the express framework and mongo as the db.
